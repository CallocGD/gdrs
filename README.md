# gdrs
A Geometry Dash api Client written in Rust Inspired by [Nekit's gdpy libaray](https://github.com/nekitdev/gd.py)
 for interacting with geometry dash's api.

Please make me a pull request if you want something to be implemented so I might be a little bit slow at this and because 
I am still learning about the rust language so any help and contributions are greatly apperciated.
