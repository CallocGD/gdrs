# gdrs
A Geometry Dash api Client written in Rust Inspired by [Nekit's gdpy libaray](https://github.com/nekitdev/gd.py)
 for interacting with geometry dash's api.

Please make me a pull request if you want something to be implemented because I am still learning about rust so help 
and contributions are greatly apperciated.
